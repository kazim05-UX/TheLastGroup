# Individual SDLC Selection

## 1.New e-Commerce site
**Agile SDLC** will work best for a new e-commerce site because e-commerce is a fast moving market where we would need to make changes depending on the user’s needs. Agile allows incremental development and flexibility when working with clients to match their needs.

## 2. Dental office site
**Waterfall SDLC** will work best for the dental website because patient information is important and we should establish safe information storage systems. Although the doctor is flexible, we want to establish the completion of the software and then make changes later on, like adding scheduling an appointment, reminder through text, and etc..


## 3. Nuclear Power Plant
**Waterfall SDLC** will work best as they want to make sure that this software is a success. As it is a nuclear power plant, it needs safety and security as a MUST, making sure that the requirements/ analysis to be done completely before moving into the new stage. With a lot of failures in previous power plants, we want to make sure that this one works, making flexibility not an option.


## 4. Department of Transportation
**Waterfall SDLC** will work best as this has a 100 page specification that it needs to follow which doesn't allow much flexibility. The waterfall method works well because there isn’t going to be huge changes to the specifications.


## 5. Reducing Traffic
**Agile SDLC** will work best as it involves traffic. We need to implement real-time data into the software so that we can refine the technical difficulties as they are discovered. Incremental development reduces the risks of huge failures later down the road.
But with it being an embedded software, waterfall might work better as incremental, or software updates can’t happen too often.

## 6. Educational game
**Agile SDLC** will work best as game requirements change frequently. With feedback from teachers, students and testers, we are required to refine gameplay and the effectiveness of the game in education. Early prototypes can be tested by teachers and students to improve the game.

## 7. Global Health
**Agile SDLC** will work best as the project doesn’t have certain requirements and has a small team. As this startup would depend on future investors, incremental development will show progress and will be able to give investors more reasons to invest in this project.
