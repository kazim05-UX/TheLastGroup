# SDLC Choices

## SDLC Models Defined
The following table defines the multitude of SDLC models discussed.
| Model | Usage |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Waterfall | Traditional programming method. Useful when large overhead is needed, ex. embedded systems or High-Risk systems. |
| Spiral Model | An extension of the Waterfall model. Suited to large companies and big projects, allows for earlier error management through prototyping. |
| Agile Programming | The opposite to the Waterfall method. Prioritizes prototypes and early customer testing. |
| Incremental Model | An extension of Agile programming, applies agile programming while splitting a system's features into several phases. Useful for delivering a bare-minimum product quickly that will be iterated upon. |

## Project Selections
### 1: New e-Commerce site
> A general **Agile Model** would work well considering that e-Commerce is a fast moving market that requires the development team to be extremely flexible. In addition, much of the documentation and framework seems to already be defined so there is no little need for overhead. 
### 2: Dental office site
> An **Incremental Model** would work best. The scenario describes several different phases of development with core feature arriving first, which is exactly what an incremental model promises. The incremental model is also agile, which means that continually adding new capabilities to the website is doable.
### 3: Nuclear Power Plant
> The **Spiral Model** should be used here. The Spiral Model is perfect for large projects by large companies such as this while simultaneously factoring in risk management by identifying problems early through prototyping. This is important because errors must be caught early, since this software will not be changed once it's deployed for 10 years.
### 4: Department of Transportation
> A standard **Waterfall method** works best. We don't have a large enough team for a Spiral method, but we do have strict documentation which requires a more rigid Waterfall development cycle.
### 5: Reducing Traffic
> A standard **Waterfall method** works here. There is not enough substantial risk to justify the cost and complexity of a Spiral Model, but as this involves embedded software, we shouldn't use any agile methods.
### 6: Educational game
> **Agile Development** seems appropriate. The team is small and the software must be developed quickly, with quick prototypes to be sent to the customer.
### 7: Global Health
> The **Incremental Method** seems the best. Deriving from the agile method it supports small development teams, while also producing a working product that will prove the company deserves further grants.
