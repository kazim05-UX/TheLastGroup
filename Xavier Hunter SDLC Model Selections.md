# Overview
This report presents **my** individual SDLC model selections for the seven distinct software projects. Each choice is based on project risk, requirement stability, stakeholder involvement, team experience, regulatory constrains, and long term maintenance expectations.

# SDLC MODELS REFERENCED
- **Waterfall** : Linear, documentation heavy, best for stable requirements
- **Agile** : Iterative, customer-driven, flexible requirements
- **Spiral** : Risk driven, combines prototyping and waterfall
- **Incremental** : Delivers system in functional pieces
- **V-Model**  : Verification & validation focuses

# Project Selections & Justifications
## Project 1: New e-Commerce Site
**Chosen Model** : Agile (scrum)
Agile is well suited due to its evolving nature around customer features like customizing and outfit matching. Iterative development allows coordination with the interpreter team while onboarding new hires and interns gradually.

## Project 2: Dental Office Site
**Chosen Model** : Incremental / Agile
The dentist wants a basic site first with features added over time. Incremental delivery allows early development while agile supports ongoing changes and implementatins like appointments and reminders.

## Project 3: Nuclear Power Plant
**Chosen Model** : Spiral w/ V-Model
This is a high risk, safety critical system with long term use. Spiral enables continuous risk analysis while the V-Model ensures rigorous verification and validation at every development stage.

## Project 4: Department of Transportation
**Chosen Model** : Waterfall
The 100 page speification and prior domain experience indicate stable requirements. Waterfall is appropriate for predictable delivery with clear milestones and compliance expectations.

## Project 5: Reducing Traffic
**Chosen Model** : Spiral
The integration of GPS devices, sensors, cameras, and real time systems introduces technical risk. Spiral supports prototyping and iterative risk mitigation while leveraging the team's embedded C++ expertise.

## Project 6: Educational Game
**Chosen Model** : Agile (scrum)
Requirements evolve rapidly based on feedback from teachers and testers. Agile enables quick releases, frequent demos, and close collaboration with educational stakeholders.

## Project 7: Global Health
**Chosen Model** : Agile
With a very small team and uncertain scope, Agile supports experimentation and fast learning. Incremental impact demonstations improve chances of securing additional grant funding.
